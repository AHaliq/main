[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-gui,*`GUI`*>>: The GUI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Util,*`Utilities`*>>: Shared resources of the App.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-GUI]]
=== GUI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/model/cards[`Cards`]

.Structure of the Model Component
image::cards_class_diagram.png[]


.`FlashCard`,

* There are 3 types of cards used by our App, the `JavascriptCard`, `FrontBackCard` and `MultipleChoiceCard`.
* `JavascriptCard` and `FrontBackCard` implements from `FlashCard`, an interface class.
* `MultipleChoiceCard` inherits from `FrontBackCard`.
* The interface class `FlashCard` also implements `JsonInterface` class to allow loading and saving to Json format.

.FlashCard Priority
Each FlashCard has an associated priority level, which the user can indicate his/her value of the importance of the card.

The priority levels are described below:

| Priority| Value| Intended Action|
| HIGH_PRIORITY| 10| Valued as important by user, should be tested more often|
| LOW_PRIORITY| 1| Valued, but less important by user, should be tested less often|

The sequence diagram below shows how the `ExamRunner` component can use the `createSubsetForTest()` method in the `Deck` and make use of the priorities associated with the `FlashCards` to create a test that emphasises the `FlashCards` that the user deems as important.

image::flashcards_priority cards.png[]

* Constructor of `ExamRunner` is called.
* In the constructor of `ExamRunner`, a method call is made to `Deck` to create a subset of cards for test.
* `Deck` processes the method call, responds as such:
** If there are less than 10 cards in `Deck`, return all the cards.
** If there are more than 10 cards in `Deck`, return a set of cards with both `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards, which the proportion is weighted at 60% to 40% ration respectively.
* `Deck` returns the test set to `ExamRunner`.

[Note]
The current implementation has yet to handle the situation where `ExamRunner` creates a test set when there are no cards in Deck. This will be implemented before the next code release.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/logic/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager.java`]
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/util/json/JsonParser.java[`JsonParser.java`]
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/util/FileReadWrite.java[`FileReadWrite.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* interface to save deck by calling `FileReadWrite`
* interface to load deck by calling `FileReadWrite`, send string to `JsonParser` and creating deck objects from `JsonValue`

The `JsonParser` component,

* takes any string of JSON format and returns a `JsonValue`

The `FileReadWrite` component,

* resolves root directory for app save data
* interface for user to provide their custom root directory
* writes file and creates path directories if none

[[Design-Util]]
=== Code Component
.Structure of the Code component within Utilities
image::CodeClassDiagram.png[]

The `Code` component supports code-running flashcards in Java and Javascript. Cards will take in user input
via the JavaScript card (Java card to be implemented soon) and

the `JavascriptRunner` class

* can evaluate JS code from a file using the `FileImporter` class
* can evaluate JS code as an input string

the `JavaRunner` class

* Read/write to the `Solution.java` file during runtime after user has typed
Java code into the file
* Compile and run `Solution.java`
* the Java code written in each card is stored in the card itself, but this `Solution.java` will be overwritten
and used to run the code in each card.

To be implemented: An in-app Flashcard Pro compiler and debugger for JS and Java as a playground for the user






[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `dream.fcard.datastructures` package and root of `dream.fcard.util`

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::parsejson[]
==== Implementation

The parsing is done by `JsonParser`.
It takes a string and attempts to read it as one of a `JsonValueTypes` and create its corresponding object wrapped in `JsonValue`.
Since Objects and Arrays can recursively contain a json value, their contents are also read, created and wrapped.

* `JsonParser#parseJsonInput()` -- constructs the `JsonValue` object from a string input

Given below is the overview activity diagram of parsing a json string input.

image::jsonParserProcessDynamicValue.png[]

It will first be tested to see if its an integer and if it fails it will be tested for a double.
Consequently, boolean, string, json object, json array.

Json object values are themselves json values thus the activity diagram is called recursively
Likewise for json array values.

[NOTE]
If all parsing types fail, there must be an error with the string input, thus a JsonFormatException is thrown.

==== Design Considerations

The JsonParser is designed to be a utility class with a pure function without any mutation of state.
Thus it should be self contained within a single function call.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Running a code flashcard
.Activity diagram for creating a code flashcard
image::JSCardActivityDiagram.png[]
==== Proposed Implementation
The code flashcard is a card that allows users to answer coding questions by running code directly.
The  following use case illustrates how the card works.

* System: FlashCard Pro
* Actor: User
* Use case: Create a code flashcard

MSS:

. The user initialises the card for the appropriate language (i.e. Java or JS)

. The user enters starter code if necessary (e.g boilerplate code, helper methods)

. The user enters test cases (specifying inputs and corresponding expected outputs).
. FlashCard Pro saves the newly created card.

Use case ends.

*Extensions:
[start=3]
. a) The user enters 0 test cases.
    .. 1) FlashCard Pro prompts for at least 1 test case.
    .. 2) The user enters a test case.
