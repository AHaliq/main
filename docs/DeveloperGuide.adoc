== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram_FlashCardPro.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.



<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-gui,*`GUI`*>>: The GUI of the App.
* <<Design-Responder,*`Responder`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Util,*`Utilities`*>>: Shared resources of the App.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user <<TBC>>.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-GUI]]
=== GUI component

.Structure of the Model Component

.`FlashCard`,

* There are 3 types of cards used by our App, the `JavascriptCard`, `FrontBackCard` and `MultipleChoiceCard`.
* `JavascriptCard` and `FrontBackCard` implements from `FlashCard`, an interface class.
* `MultipleChoiceCard` inherits from `FrontBackCard`.
* The interface class `FlashCard` also implements `JsonInterface` class to allow loading and saving to Json format.

.FlashCard Priority
Each FlashCard has an associated priority level, which the user can indicate his/her value of the importance of the card.

The priority levels are described below:

| Priority| Value| Intended Action|
| HIGH_PRIORITY| 10| Valued as important by user, should be tested more often|
| LOW_PRIORITY| 1| Valued, but less important by user, should be tested less often|

The sequence diagram below shows how the `ExamRunner` component can use the `createSubsetForTest()` method in the `Deck` and make use of the priorities associated with the `FlashCards` to create a test that emphasises the `FlashCards` that the user deems as important.

image::flashcards_priority cards.png[]

* Constructor of `ExamRunner` is called.
* In the constructor of `ExamRunner`, a method call is made to `Deck` to create a subset of cards for test.
* `Deck` processes the method call, responds as such:
** If there are less than 10 cards in `Deck`, return all the cards.
** If there are more than 10 cards in `Deck`, return a set of cards with both `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards, which the proportion is weighted at 60% to 40% ration respectively.
* `Deck` returns the test set to `ExamRunner`.

[Note]
The current implementation has yet to handle the situation where `ExamRunner` creates a test set when there are no cards in Deck. This will be implemented before the next code release.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


=== [Proposed] Saving User Statistics feature
==== Proposed Implementation

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How saving executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
